Installation:
=============

1) Go to the source directory, Src

2) By default the installation will use gfortran as the compiler. If you wish to change
this then edit the Makefile

3) To build just the library, type:

  make lib

4) To build an executable "pGFNFF" based on main.F90 calling the library, type:

  make exe
